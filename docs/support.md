## Community Support

Free Support: Available through Discord and Github tickets.

We help people get started with Tactical RMM using supported methods as documented here in the [public documentation](https://docs.tacticalrmm.com/).

We may give pointers, or provide additional troubleshooting steps if we believe your issue may be related to a recent update or bug.

## Commercial Support

We can help with lots of problems including many #unsupported installations and configurations.

You get Priority #1 fast responses and service.

### If you have received this link

If you are reading this because this link was shared with you, it has been determined that your installation has fallen under the #Unsupported category. Probably because you are using something from [Unsupported](unsupported_guidelines.md)

We will be happy to assist you with troubleshooting and (probably) fixing your problem if you [contact Amidaware Support](https://support.amidaware.com).
