# Community Scripts

## Script Library Naming Conventions

### File Names

Under `/scripts` the file name should generally follow this format:

```text
(Platform)_(Category or Function)_(What It Does).xxx
```

Platforms for now are:

```text
Win_
nix_bash_
nix_zsh_macos_
nix_sh_
nix_sh_truenas_
nix_bash_freepbx_
ios_
android_
```

Good filename examples include:

```text
Win_Azure_Mars_Cloud_Backup_Status.ps1
Win_AzureAD_Check_Connection_Status.ps1
Win_Network_DHCP_Set.bat
Win_Network_DNS_Set_to_1.1.1.2.ps1
```

!!!info
    This is so that at a glance you can see if there is already a script with that function, and you can avoid duplication of functionality.

### Name Field (in community_scripts.json)

Consider they are viewed in 3 different locations:

**Script Manager**

- List View (sortable by any column)

- Folder View (Grouped by Categories)

**Run or Add Script**

- Running scripts manually or adding tasks (or adding in Automation Manager).

!!!info
    A good max length is 50-60 chars or less for display in these 3 locations.

Make sure your Name roughly follows the order of file naming as above.

```text
Category or Function - What It Does
```

 Consider how the alphabetic sort will affect display.

### JSON Field Names

Example

```json
{
    "guid": "bfd61545-839b-45da-8b3d-75ffc4d43272",
    "filename": "Win_Sophos_EndpointProtection_Install.ps1",
    "submittedBy": "https://github.com/bc24fl/",
    "name": "Sophos Endpoint Protection Install",
    "description": "Installs Sophos Endpoint Protection via the Sophos API.  Products include Antivirus, InterceptX, MDR, Device Encryption.  The script requires API credentials, Custom Fields, and Arguments passed to script.  See script comments for details",
    "args": [
      "-ClientId {{client.SophosClientId}}",
      "-ClientSecret {{client.SophosClientSecret}}",
      "-TenantName {{client.SophosTenantName}}",
      "-Products antivirus,intercept"
    ],
    "default_timeout": "3600",
    "supported_platforms": ["windows"],
    "shell": "powershell",
    "category": "TRMM (Win):3rd Party Software"
  },
```

**Notes**

`guid`: Must be unique in the file.

`filename`: File with that name must exist in `/scripts` folder.

`submittedBy`: Get credit for creator.

`args`: default args pre-filled in arg field.

`default_timeout`: Sets the default timeout for the script.

`supported_platforms`: ["windows", "linux", "darwin"] (case sensitive, if missing, assumes all platforms are supported). `darwin`=MacOS

`shell`: can be `powershell`, `cmd`, `python` or `shell`

`syntax`: See [scripting](functions/scripting.md#)

`category`: Preferably use existing categories and format structure for library sorting, add new as needed.

## Making Script Files

### Good Habits

- Try and make them fully self-contained.

- If they pull data from elsewhere, create comment notes at the top with references for others to audit/validate.

- Good folder locations to use for standardized things:

```text
c:\ProgramData\TacticalRMM\
c:\ProgramData\TacticalRMM\scripts
c:\ProgramData\TacticalRMM\toolbox
c:\ProgramData\TacticalRMM\logs
c:\ProgramData\TacticalRMM\temp
```

- Command Parameters are good. Optional command parameters for extra functions are better.

```powershell
param(
    [string] $Username,
    [switch] $log,
    [int] $numberofdays,
    [array] $packages #separated by commas
)

```

- Add standardized Comment headers to scripts (include the first 2, more if appropriate):

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
   Short description
   eg Check IP address

.DESCRIPTION
   Long description
   eg Checks IP address on all local network adapters, and returns results

.PARAMETER xx
   Inputs to this cmdlet (if any)

.PARAMETER yy
   Inputs to this cmdlet (if any)

.OUTPUTS
   Output from this cmdlet (if any)

.EXAMPLE
   Example of how to use this cmdlet

.EXAMPLE
   Another example of how to use this cmdlet

.NOTES
   General notes
   eg v1.0
#>
```

### Bad Habits

- Assumes non-standard configurations.

- Doesn't play well with other community scripts (reused names etc.).

## Script Parameters



## Useful Reference Script Examples

RunAsUser (since Tactical RMM runs as system)
<https://github.com/amidaware/community-scripts/blob/main/scripts/Win_Display_Message_To_User.ps1>

Command Parameter Ninja
<https://github.com/amidaware/community-scripts/blob/main/scripts/Win_ScreenConnectAIO.ps1>

Optional Command Parameters and testing for errors

## Volunteers Needed

If you want to contribute back to the project there are a lot of scripts that need some TLC (Tender Loving Care) please peruse thru them in The Script WIP (Work In Progress): <https://github.com/amidaware/community-scripts/tree/main/scripts_wip>

Discuss/ask questions in the Discord group [here](https://discord.com/channels/736478043522072608/744281869499105290).

What you can add is:

- Add standardized Comment headers per above.
- Consolidate and parameterize scripts where appropriate.
- Add $ExitCode and error conditions as appropriate.
- Contact @silversword in Discord if you need help doing Github additions/edits/adding to the community Library and have questions about [Script Library Naming Conventions](#script-library-naming-conventions).
