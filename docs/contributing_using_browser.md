## Getting Started

### 3. Request your changes to be pulled into the primary repo (Pull Request)

![Changes you've made need integration with master repo](images/trmm_contribute-notice.png)

This is taking your changes and requesting they be integrated into the Tactical RMM develop branch.

#### 3a. Check the status of your PR

Look at a summary of the changes you've requested, monitor for them to be accepted, or commented on.

<https://github.com/wh1te909/tacticalrmm/pulls>

Once they're accepted you can either:
* Delete your fork
* Sync your local fork

#### 4. Sync your fork

<https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork>

Bring changes from original repo to your fork so you're current with changes made in original Github repo

Goto Step 2. and contribute some more

## Notes

After your changes are accepted, they won't be live in Tactical RMM until there is a new [release](https://github.com/wh1te909/tacticalrmm/releases). #BePatient
